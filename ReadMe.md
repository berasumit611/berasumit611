## üí´ About Me:

Hello, and welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Sumit Bera, and I'm currently a final year undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering.

My programming skills include C, C++, and JavaScript, and I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies to improve my skills as a developer. I'm particularly interested in front-end web development, and I'm currently honing my skills in this area.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I'm also an aspiring front-end developer, and I'm actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills in real-world projects. I'm a hard-working and detail-oriented individual with excellent problem-solving skills, and I'm always looking for ways to challenge myself and push the boundaries of what's possible.
