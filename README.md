# Hi there! 👋  

I’m a **Software Development Engineer (SDE 1)** at **AIQuant Technologies**, passionate about building scalable and innovative software solutions. My expertise spans a wide range of technologies, including frontend development with `React.js`, `Angular.js`, `Vue.js`, and `Tailwind CSS`. On the backend, I work with `Node.js`, `Express.js`, and implement solutions with databases like `MongoDB`, `MySQL`, and `PostgreSQL`. I have strong experience in `Core Java` and `Spring Boot` for building robust backend services.  

I am also deeply interested in blockchain technology, working with the `Cardano` blockchain, `smart contracts`, and tools like `Lucid.js`, `IPFS`, `Pinata`, `Mesh.js`. Additionally, I incorporate `Docker` for containerization to streamline development and deployment processes. I’m constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape.  

Feel free to explore my projects and connect with me to collaborate on exciting ideas! 😊
